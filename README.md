Topic Extraction From articles

The target of this program is to identify the G20 countries discussed about in each article. This may be directly talking about the country or indirect references. For example, if the article mentions White House, we should identify that the article is referencing USA.

The next step is to further identify and group the articles into themes.
Each Row in the Dataframe is a article from BBC.

The G20 is made up of 19 countries and the European Union. The 19 countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the US.
